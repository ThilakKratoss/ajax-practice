        <h1>Collaborative Software</h1>
        <p>Collaborative software is a</br> great tool for businesses and organizations </br>of all sizes, including virtual based offices. It is useful for group-based </br>projects where multiple employees are working on a single assignment, or otherwise need to actively communicate in real</br> time. Modern intranets offer much more and have become capable platforms to help production and ease workload in many industries.</p>
